        <p>This survey will only take a couple of minutes! You'll be asked a series of questions, and you just have to select 'Yes' or 'No' depending on how you feel.</p>
        <p>At the end, this program will come to a conclusion on what you may be going through, and it will give you suggestions on how to approach the matter. This information will be directly from the CDC!</p>
